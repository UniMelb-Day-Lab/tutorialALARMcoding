abstract = {Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) a widely used treatment for uncomplicated malaria and recommended for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, is being investigated for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants (IPTi). High levels of drug resistance to SP have been reported from north-eastern Tanzania associated with mutations in parasite genes. This study compared the in vivo efficacy of SP in symptomatic 6–59 month children with uncomplicated malaria and in asymptomatic 2–10 month old infants. An open label single arm (SP) standard 28 day in vivo WHO antimalarial efficacy protocol was used in 6 to 59 months old symptomatic children and a modified protocol used in 2 to 10 months old asymptomatic infants. Enrolment was stopped early (87 in the symptomatic and 25 in the asymptomatic studies) due to the high failure rate. Molecular markers were examined for recrudescence, re-infection and markers of drug resistance and a review of literature of studies looking for the 581G dhps mutation was carried out. In symptomatic children PCR-corrected early treatment failure was 38.8% (95% CI 26.8–50.8) and total failures by day 28 were 82.2% (95% CI 72.5–92.0). There was no significant difference in treatment failures between asymptomatic and symptomatic children. 96% of samples carried parasites with mutations at codons 51, 59 and 108 in the dhfr gene and 63% carried a double mutation at codons 437 and 540. 55% carried a third mutation with the addition of a mutation at codon 581 in the dhps gene. This triple: triple haplotype maybe associated with earlier treatment failure. In northern Tanzania SP is a failed drug for treatment and its utility for prophylaxis is doubtful. The study found a new combination of parasite mutations that maybe associated with increased and earlier failure. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00361114},

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum malaria originated in Africa and became global as humans migrated to other continents. During this journey, parasites encountered new mosquito species, some of them evolutionarily distant from African vectors. We have previously shown that the Pfs47 protein allows the parasite to evade the mosquito immune system of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. Here, we investigated the role of Pfs47-mediated immune evasion in the adaptation of P. falciparum to evolutionarily distant mosquito species. We found that P. falciparum isolates from Africa, Asia, or the Americas have low compatibility to malaria vectors from a different continent, an effect that is mediated by the mosquito immune system. We identified 42 different haplotypes of Pfs47 that have a strong geographic population structure and much lower haplotype diversity outside Africa. Replacement of the Pfs47 haplotypes in a P. falciparum isolate is sufficient to make it compatible to a different mosquito species. Those parasites that express a Pfs47 haplotype compatible with a given vector evade antiplasmodial immunity and survive. We propose that Pfs47-mediated immune evasion has been critical for the globalization of P. falciparum malaria as parasites adapted to new vector species. Our findings predict that this ongoing selective force by the mosquito immune system could influence the dispersal of Plasmodium genetic traits and point to Pfs47 as a potential target to block malaria transmission. A new model, the “lock-and-key theory” of P. falciparum globalization, is proposed, and its implications are discussed.},

However, this strategy is compromised by widespread drug resistance from single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthetase genes. During September 2008–October 2010, we monitored a cohort of 924 pregnant women in an area of Tanzania with declining malaria transmission. P. falciparum parasites were genotyped, and the effect of infecting haplotypes on birthweight was assessed. Of the genotyped parasites, 9.3%, 46.3%, and 44.4% had quadruple or less, quintuple, and sextuple mutated haplotypes, respectively. Mutant haplotypes were unrelated to SP doses. Compared with infections with the less-mutated haplotypes, infections with the sextuple haplotype mutation were associated with lower (359 g) birthweights. Continued use of the suboptimal IPTp-SP regimen should be reevaluated, and alternative strategies (e.g., intermittent screening and treatment or intermittent treatment with safe and effective alternative drugs) should be evaluated.},

Moreover, since cases of ACT resistance have been reported in South-East Asia, the need to understand P. falciparum resistance mechanism to ACT has become a global research goal. The selective pressure of ACT and the possibility that some specific Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 alleles are associated with treatment failures was assessed in a clinical trial comparing ASAQ to AL in Nanoro. Dried blood spots collected on Day 0 and on the day of recurrent parasitaemia during the 28-day follow-up were analyzed using the restriction fragments length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Pfcrt (codon76) and Pfmdr1 (codons 86, 184, 1034, 1042, and 1246) genes. Multivariate analysis of the relationship between the presence of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 alleles and treatment outcome was performed. AL and ASAQ exerted opposite trends in selecting Pfcrt K76T and Pfmdr1-N86Y alleles, raising the potential beneficial effect of using diverse ACT at the same time as first line treatments to reduce the selective pressure by each treatment regimen. No clear association between the presence of Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 alleles carried at baseline and treatment failure was observed.},

Plasmodium falciparum surface protein Pfs47 is critical in the parasite's survival by manipulating the vector's immune system hence a promising target for blocking transmission in the mosquito. This study aimed to examine the genetic diversity, haplotype distribution, and population structure of Pfs47 and its implications on malaria infections in endemic lowlands in Western Kenya. Cross-sectional mass blood screening was conducted in malaria endemic regions in the lowlands of Western Kenya: Homa Bay, Kombewa, and Chulaimbo. Dried blood spots and slide smears were simultaneously collected in 2018 and 2019. DNA was extracted using Chelex method from microscopic Plasmodium falciparum positive samples and used to genotype Pfs47 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Thirteen observed haplotypes of the Pfs47 gene were circulating in Western Kenya. Population-wise, haplotype diversity ranged from 0.69 to 0.77 and the nucleotide diversity 0.10 to 0.12 across all sites. All the study sites displayed negative Tajima's D values although not significant. However, the negative and significant Fu's Fs statistical values were observed across all the study sites, suggesting population expansion or positive selection. Overall genetic differentiation index was not significant (FST = -0.00891, P > 0.05) among parasite populations. All Nm values revealed a considerable gene flow in these populations. These results could have important implications for the persistence of high levels of malaria transmission and should be considered when designing potential targeted control interventions.},

abstract = {The emergence of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in Southeast Asia, manifested as delayed clearance of Plasmodium falciparum following treatment with artemisinins, is a major concern. Recently, the artemisinin resistance phenotype was attributed to mutations in portions of a P. falciparum gene (PF3D7_1343700) encoding kelch (K13) propeller domains, providing a molecular marker to monitor the spread of resistance. The P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2 (FP2; PF3D7_1115700) has been shown to contribute to artemisinin action, as hemoglobin degradation is required for potent drug activity, and a stop mutation in the FP2 gene was identified in parasites selected for artemisinin resistance. Although delayed parasite clearance after artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has not yet been noted in Uganda and ACTs remain highly efficacious, characterizing the diversity of these genes is important to assess the potential for resistance selection and to provide a baseline for future surveillance. We therefore sequenced the K13-propeller domain and FP2 gene in P. falciparum isolates from children previously treated with ACT in Uganda, including samples from 2006–7 (n = 49) and from 2010–12 (n = 175). Using 3D7 as the reference genome, we identified 5 non-synonymous polymorphisms in the K13-propeller domain (133 isolates) and 35 in FP2 (160 isolates); these did not include the polymorphisms recently associated with resistance after in vitro selection or identified in isolates from Asia. The prevalence of K13-propeller and FP2 polymorphisms did not increase over time, and was not associated with either time since prior receipt of an ACT or the persistence of parasites ≥2 days following treatment with an ACT. Thus, the K13-propeller and FP2 polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance are not prevalent in Uganda, and we did not see evidence for selection of polymorphisms in these genes.},

abstract = {Artemether–lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate–amodiaquine (AS-AQ) are the most commonly used artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum in Africa. Both treatments remain efficacious, but single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (Pfmdr1) gene may compromise sensitivity. AL and AS-AQ exert opposing selective pressures: parasites with genotype 86Y, Y184 and 1246Y are partially resistant to AS-AQ treatment, while N86, 184 F and D1246 are favoured by AL treatment. Through a systematic review, we identified 397 surveys measuring the prevalence of Pfmdr1 polymorphisms at positions 86 184 or 1246 in 30 countries in Africa. Temporal trends in SNP frequencies after introduction of AL or AS-AQ as first-line treatment were analysed in 32 locations, and selection coefficients estimated. We examined associations between antimalarial policies, consumption, transmission intensity and rate of SNP selection. 1246Y frequency decreased on average more rapidly in locations where national policy recommended AL (median selection coefficient(s) of −0.083), compared with policies of AS-AQ or both AL and AS-AQ (median s=−0.035 and 0.021, p<0.001 respectively). 86Y frequency declined markedly after ACT policy introduction, with a borderline significant trend for a more rapid decline in countries with AL policies (p=0.055). However, these trends could also be explained by a difference in initial SNP frequencies at the time of ACT introduction. There were non-significant trends for faster selection of N86 and D1246 in areas with higher AL consumption and no trend with transmission intensity. Recorded consumption of AS-AQ was low in the locations and times Pfmdr1 data were collected. SNP trends in countries with AL policies suggest a broad increase in sensitivity of parasites to AS-AQ, by 7–10 years after AL introduction. Observed rates of selection have implications for planning strategies to cycle drugs or use multiple first-line therapies to maintain drug efficacy.},

abstract = {Malaria parasites break down host haemoglobin into peptides and amino acids in the digestive vacuole for export to the parasite cytoplasm for growth: interrupting this process is central to the mode of action of several antimalarial drugs. Mutations in the chloroquine (CQ) resistance transporter, pfcrt, located in the digestive vacuole membrane, confer CQ resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, and typically also affect parasite fitness. However, the role of other parasite loci in the evolution of CQ resistance is unclear. Here we use a combination of population genomics, genetic crosses and gene editing to demonstrate that a second vacuolar transporter plays a key role in both resistance and compensatory evolution. Longitudinal genomic analyses of the Gambian parasites revealed temporal signatures of selection on a putative amino acid transporter (pfaat1) variant S258L, which increased from 0% to 97% in frequency between 1984 and 2014 in parallel with the pfcrt1 K76T variant. Parasite genetic crosses then identified a chromosome 6 quantitative trait locus containing pfaat1 that is selected by CQ treatment. Gene editing demonstrated that pfaat1 S258L potentiates CQ resistance but at a cost of reduced fitness, while pfaat1 F313S, a common southeast Asian polymorphism, reduces CQ resistance while restoring fitness. Our analyses reveal hidden complexity in CQ resistance evolution, suggesting that pfaat1 may underlie regional differences in the dynamics of resistance evolution, and modulate parasite resistance or fitness by manipulating the balance between both amino acid and drug transport. Chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is characterized using population genomics, genetic crosses and gene editing.},

Pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites were also highly related, with evidence of clonal transmissions at the district level. Of concern, 8.2% of K13 622I parasites also carried the pfhrp2/3 deletions.

abstract = {Background. In treating malaria in Uganda, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) has been associated with a lower risk of recurrent parasitemia, compared with artesunate-amodiaquine (AS/AQ), but changing treatment practices may have altered parasite susceptibility. Methods. We enrolled 602 children aged 6–59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria from 3 health centers in 2013–2014 and randomly assigned them to receive treatment with AS/AQ or AL. Primary outcomes were risks of recurrent parasitemia within 28 days, with or without adjustment to distinguish recrudescence from new infection. Drug safety and tolerability and Plasmodium falciparum resistance–mediating polymorphisms were assessed. Results. Of enrolled patients, 594 (98.7%) completed the 28-day study. Risks of recurrent parasitemia were lower with AS/AQ at all 3 sites (overall, 28.6% vs 44.6%; P < .001). Recrudescences were uncommon, and all occurred after AL treatment (0% vs 2.5%; P = .006). Recovery of the hemoglobin level was greater with AS/AQ (1.73 vs 1.39 g/dL; P = .04). Both regimens were well tolerated; serious adverse events were uncommon (1.7% in the AS/AQ group and 1.0% in the AL group). AS/AQ selected for mutant pfcrt/pfmdr1 polymorphisms and AL for wild-type pfcrt/pfmdr1 polymorphisms associated with altered drug susceptibility. Conclusions. AS/AQ treatment was followed by fewer recurrences than AL treatment, contrasting with older data. Each regimen selected for polymorphisms associated with decreased treatment response. Research should consider multiple or rotating regimens to maintain treatment efficacies.},

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a devastating public health problem. Recent discoveries have shed light on the origin and evolution of Plasmodium parasites and their interactions with their vertebrate and mosquito hosts. P. falciparum malaria originated in Africa from a single horizontal transfer between an infected gorilla and a human, and became global as the result of human migration. Today, P. falciparum malaria is transmitted worldwide by more than 70 different anopheline mosquito species. Recent studies indicate that the mosquito immune system can be a barrier to malaria transmission and that the P. falciparum Pfs47 gene allows the parasite to evade mosquito immune detection. Here, we review the origin and globalization of P. falciparum and integrate this history with analysis of the biology, evolution, and dispersal of the main mosquito vectors. This new perspective broadens our understanding of P. falciparum population structure and the dispersal of important parasite genetic traits. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Genetics Volume 50 is November 23, 2016. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.},

abstract = {Single and multiple mutations at residues 16, 51, 59, 108, and 164 of Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfDHFR) have been linked to antifolate resistance in malaria. We prepared and characterized all seven of the pfDHFR mutants found in nature, as well as six mutants not observed in nature. Mutations involving residues 51, 59, 108, or 164 conferred cross resistance to both the antifolates pyrimethamine and cycloguanil, whereas mutation of residue 16 specifically conferred resistance to cycloguanil. The antifolate resistance of enzyme mutants found in nature correlated with in vivo antifolate resistance; however, mutants not found in nature were either poorly resistant or had insufficient catalytic activity to support DNA synthesis. Thus, specific combinations of multiple mutations at target residues were selected in nature to optimize resistance. Further, the resistance of multiple mutants was more than the sum of the component single mutations, indicating that residues were selected for their synergistic as well as intrinsic effects on resistance. Pathways inferred for the evolution of pyrimethamine-resistant mutants suggested that all multiple mutants emerged from stepwise selection of the single mutant, S108N. Thus, we propose that drugs targeted to both the wild-type pfDHFR and S108N mutant would have a low propensity for developing resistance, and hence could provide effective antimalarial agents.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Treatment of acute malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum may include long-half-life drugs, such as the antifolate combination sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), to provide posttreatment chemoprophylaxis against parasite recrudescence or delayed emergence from the liver. An unusual case of P. falciparum recrudescence in a returned British traveler who received such a regimen, as well as a series of 44 parasite isolates from the same hospital, was analyzed by PCR and direct DNA sequencing for the presence of markers of parasite resistance to chloroquine and antifolates. The index patient harbored a mixture of wild-type and resistant pfdhfr and pfdhps alleles upon initial presentation. During his second malaria episode, he harbored only resistant parasites, with the haplotypes IRNI (codons 51, 59, 108, and 164) and SGEAA (codons 436, 437, 540, 581, and 613) at these two loci, respectively. Analysis of isolates from 44 other patients showed that the pfdhfr haplotype IRNI was common (found in 81% of cases). The SGEAA haplotype of pfdhps was uncommon (found only in eight cases of East African origin [17%]). A previously undescribed mutation, I431V, was observed for seven cases of Nigerian origin, occurring as one of two haplotypes, VAGKGS or VAGKAA. The presence of this mutation was also confirmed in isolates of Nigerian origin from the United Kingdom Malaria Reference Laboratory. The presence of the pfdhps haplotype SGEAA in P. falciparum parasites of East African origin appears to compromise the efficacy of treatment regimens that include SP as a means to prevent recrudescence. Parasites with novel pfdhps haplotypes are circulating in West Africa. The response of these parasites to chemotherapy needs to be evaluated.},

To explore the chain of casualty underlying artemisinin resistance, we reanalyze 773 P. falciparum isolates from TRACI-study integrating TWAS, GWAS, and eQTL analyses. We find the majority of P. falciparum parasites are transcriptomically converged within each geographic site with two broader physiological profiles across the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). We report 8720 SNP-expression linkages in the eastern GMS parasites and 4537 in the western. The minimal overlap between them suggests differential gene regulatory networks facilitating parasite adaptations to their unique host environments. Finally, we identify two genetic and physiological backgrounds associating with artemisinin resistance in the GMS, together with a farnesyltransferase protein and a thioredoxin-like protein which may act as vital intermediators linking the Pfk13 C580Y mutation to the prolonged parasite clearance time. Mechanisms underlying increasing artemisinin resistance of Plasmodium in Southeast Asia remain unclear. Here, Zhu et al. integrate TWAS, GWAS and eQTL analyses for 773 P. falciparum isolates and identify genetic and transcriptomic backgrounds to artemisinin resistance.},

Its use has been limited by the rapid development of resistance by parasites around the world. We have determined the cycloguanil- and pyrimethamine-sensitivity status of 10 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum and have sequenced in all these isolates the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate: NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) portion of the DHFR-thymidylate synthase (TS; 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate: dUMP C-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.45) gene. Instead of the known serine-to-asparagine change at position 108 that is important in pyrimethamine resistance, a serine-to-threonine change at the same position is found in cycloguanil-resistant isolates along with an alanine-to-valine change at position 16. We conclude that pyrimethamine and cycloguanil resistance most commonly involve alternative mutations at the same site. However, we also have identified a parasite with a unique set of changes that results in resistance to both drugs.},

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum uncomplicated malaria can successfully be treated with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). However resistance is spreading to the different ACT compounds; the artemisinin derivative and the partner drug. Studies of P. falciparum polymorphisms associated with drug resistance can provide a useful tool to track resistance and guide treatment policy as well as an in-depth understanding of the development and spread of resistance. The role of P. falciparum molecular markers in selection of reinfections was assessed in an efficacy trial comparing artesunate–amodiaquine fixed-dose combination with artemether–lumefantrine to treat malaria in Nimba County, Liberia 2008–2009. P. falciparum polymorphisms in pfcrt 76, pfmdr1 86, 184 and 1246, and pfmrp1 876 and 1466 were analysed by PCR-RFLP and pyrosequencing. High baseline prevalence of pfmdr1 1246Y was found in Nimba county (38 %). Pfmdr1 1246Y and pfmdr1 86+184+1246 haplotypes NYY and YYY were selected in reinfections in the artesunate–amodiaquine arm and pfcrt K76, pfmdr1 N86 and pfmdr1 haplotype NFD were selected in artemether–lumefantrine reinfections. Parasites harbouring pfmdr1 1246Y could reinfect earlier after treatment with artesunate–amodiaquine and parasites carrying pfmdr1 N86 could reinfect at higher lumefantrine concentrations in patients treated with artemether–lumefantrine. Although treatment is highly efficacious, selection of molecular markers in reinfections could indicate a decreased sensitivity or tolerance of parasites to the current treatments and the baseline prevalence of molecular markers should be closely monitored. Since individual drug levels and the day of reinfection were demonstrated to be key determinants for selection of reinfections, this data needs to be collected and taken into account for accurate evaluation of molecular markers for anti-malarial treatments.

One hundred one children with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections were treated with the standard dosage of AQ and followed-up for 28 days. Blood samples were collected on filter paper samples at enrollment and during follow-up for identification of parasite genotypes and pfcrt and pfmdr1 mutations using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism approaches. Parasitologic assessment of response to treatment showed that 87% and 13% (RI) of patients were cured and failed treatment, respectively. Although infections in patients were polyclonal (as determined by merozoite surface protein 2 genotyping), the presence of both mutants pfcrtT76 and pfmdr1Y86 alleles in parasites is associated with in vivo AQ resistance (odds ratio = 7.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.58-36.25, P = 0.006) and is selected by the drug in children who failed AQ treatment. Treatment failure with the combination of mutant pfcrtT76 and pfmdr1Y86 alleles as well as the ability of patients to clear these resistant parasites is dependent on age, suggesting a critical role of host immunity in clearing AQ-resistant P. falciparum. The combination of mutant pfcrtT76 and pfmdr1Y86 alleles may be useful markers for monitoring the development and spread of AQ resistance, when combining this drug with other antimalarials for treatment of malaria in Africa.},

abstract = {High‐throughput Plasmodium genomic data is increasingly useful in assessing prevalence of clinically important mutations and malaria transmission patterns. Understanding parasite diversity is important for identification of specific human or parasite populations that can be targeted by control programs, and to monitor the spread of mutations associated with drug resistance. An up‐to‐date understanding of regional parasite population dynamics is also critical to monitor the impact of control efforts. However, this data is largely absent from high‐burden nations in Africa, and to date, no such analysis has been conducted for malaria parasites in Tanzania country‐wide. To this end, over 1,000 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected in 2017 from 13 sites in seven administrative regions across Tanzania, and parasites were genotyped at 1,800 variable positions genome‐wide using molecular inversion probes. Population structure was detectable among Tanzanian P. falciparum parasites, roughly separating parasites from the northern and southern districts and identifying genetically admixed populations in the north. Isolates from nearby districts were more likely to be genetically related compared to parasites sampled from more distant districts. Known drug resistance mutations were seen at increased frequency in northern districts (including two infections carrying pfk13‐R561H), and additional variants with undetermined significance for antimalarial resistance also varied by geography. Malaria Indicator Survey (2017) data corresponded with genetic findings, including average region‐level complexity‐of‐infection and malaria prevalence estimates. The parasite populations identified here provide important information on extant spatial patterns of genetic diversity of Tanzanian parasites, to which future surveys of genetic relatedness can be compared.},

abstract = {Background Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are used worldwide as first-line treatment against confirmed or suspected Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Despite the success of ACTs at reducing the global burden of malaria, emerging resistance to artemisinin threatens these gains. Countering onset of resistance might need deliberate tactics aimed at slowing the reduction in ACT effectiveness. We assessed optimum use of ACTs at the population level, specifically focusing on a strategy of multiple first-line therapies (MFT), and comparing it with strategies of cycling or sequential use of single first-line ACTs. Methods With an individual-based microsimulation of regional malaria transmission, we looked at how to apply a therapy as widely as possible without accelerating reduction of efficacy by drug resistance. We compared simultaneous distribution of artemether–lumefantrine, artesunate–amodiaquine, and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (ie, MFT) against strategies in which these ACTs would be cycled or used sequentially, either on a fixed schedule or when population-level efficacy reaches the WHO threshold of 10% treatment failure. The main assessment criterion was total number of treatment failures per 100 people per year. Additionally, we analysed the benefits of including a single non-ACT therapy in an MFT strategy, and did sensitivity analyses in which we varied transmission setting, treatment coverage, partner-drug half-life, fitness cost of drug resistance, and the relation between drug concentration and resistance evolution. Findings Use of MFT was predicted to reduce the long-term number of treatment failures compared with strategies in which a single first-line ACT is recommended. This result was robust to various epidemiological, pharmacological, and evolutionary features of malaria transmission. Inclusion of a single non-ACT therapy in an MFT strategy would have substantial benefits in reduction of pressure on artemisinin resistance evolution, delaying its emergence and slowing its spread. Interpretation Adjusting national antimalarial treatment guidelines to encourage simultaneous use of MFT is likely to extend the useful therapeutic life of available antimalarial drugs, resulting in long-term beneficial outcomes for patients.

abstract = {Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites that is transmitted through the bites of infected anopheline mosquitoes. P. falciparum dispersal from Africa, as a result of human migration, required adaptation of the parasite to several different indigenous anopheline species. The mosquito immune system can greatly limit infection and P. falciparum evolved a strategy to evade these responses that is mediated by the Pfs47 gene. Pfs47 is a polymorphic gene with signatures of diversifying selection and a strong geographic genetic structure at a continental level. Here, we investigated the role of single four amino acid differences between the Pfs47 gene from African (GB4 and NF54) and a New World (7G8) strains that differ drastically in their ability to evade the immune system of A. gambiae L35 refractory mosquitoes. Wild type NF54 and GB4 parasites can survive in this mosquito strain, while 7G8 parasites are eliminated. Our studies indicate that replacement in any of these four single amino acids in Pfs47 from the NF54 strain by those present in 7G8, completely disrupts the ability of NF54 parasites to hide from the mosquito immune system. One of these amino acid replacements had the opposite effect on A. albimanus mosquitoes, and enhanced infection. We conclude that malaria transmission involves a complex interplay between the genetic background of the parasite and the mosquito and that Pfs47 can be critical in this interaction as it mediates Plasmodium immune evasion through molecular interactions that need to be precise in some parasite/vector combinations.},

abstract = {Understanding and controlling the spread of antimalarial resistance, particularly to artemisinin and its partner drugs, is a top priority. Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant to chloroquine, amodiaquine, or piperaquine harbor mutations in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT), a transporter resident on the digestive vacuole membrane that in its variant forms can transport these weak-base 4-aminoquinoline drugs out of this acidic organelle, thus preventing these drugs from binding heme and inhibiting its detoxification. The structure of PfCRT, solved by cryogenic electron microscopy, shows mutations surrounding an electronegative central drug-binding cavity where they presumably interact with drugs and natural substrates to control transport. P. falciparum susceptibility to heme-binding antimalarials is also modulated by overexpression or mutations in the digestive vacuole membrane–bound ABC transporter PfMDR1 (P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 transporter). Artemisinin resistance is primarily mediated by mutations in P. falciparum Kelch13 protein (K13), a protein involved in multiple intracellular processes including endocytosis of hemoglobin, which is required for parasite growth and artemisinin activation. Combating drug-resistant malaria urgently requires the development of new antimalarial drugs with novel modes of action.},

abstract = {Amodiaquine (AQ) is currently being used as a partner drug in combination with artesunate for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in most endemic countries of Africa. In the absence of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance, molecular markers of resistance to AQ may be useful for monitoring the development and spread of parasites resistance to Artesunate–Amodiaquine combination. This study was designed to assess the potential role of polymorphisms on pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes and parasite in vitro susceptibility for epidemiological surveillance of amodiaquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. The modified schizont inhibition assay was used to determine in vitro susceptibility profiles of 98 patients' isolates of P. falciparum to amodiaquine. Polymorphisms on parasites pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes were determined with nested PCR followed by sequencing.The geometric mean (GM) of AQ 50% inhibitory concentration (IC-50) in the 97 P. falciparum isolates was 20.48nM (95% CI 16.53–25.36nM). Based on the cut-off value for AQ in vitro susceptibility, 87% (84) of the P. falciparum isolates were sensitive to AQ (GM IC-50=16.32nM; 95%CI 13.3–20.04nM) while 13% were resistant to AQ in vitro (GM IC-50=88.73nM; 95%CI 69.67–113.0nM). Molecular analysis showed presence of mutant CVIET pfcrt haplotype, mutant pfmdr1Tyr86 allele and the double mutant CVIET pfcrt haplotype+pfmdr1Tyr86 in 72%, 49% and 35%, respectively. The GM IC-50 of isolates harboring the wild-type pfcrt CVMNK haplotype+pfmdr1Asn86 allele (3.93nM; 95%CI 1.82–8.46nM) was significantly lower (p=0.001) than those isolates harboring the double mutant pfcrt CVIET haplotype+pfmdr1Tyr86 allele (50.40nM; 95%CI 40.17–63.24nM).Results from this study suggest that polymorphisms in pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes are important for AQ resistance and therefore may be useful for epidemiological surveillance of P. falciparum resistance to AQ.},

The pfdhfr N51I, C59R, S108N triple mutant had a prevalence close to 100% (96/100) and no mutations at codons 50 and 164 were detected in either of the groups.

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin derivatives in southeast Asia threatens malaria control and elimination activities worldwide. To monitor the spread of artemisinin resistance, a molecular marker is urgently needed. Here, using whole-genome sequencing of an artemisinin-resistant parasite line from Africa and clinical parasite isolates from Cambodia, we associate mutations in the PF3D7_1343700 kelch propeller domain (‘K13-propeller') with artemisinin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mutant K13-propeller alleles cluster in Cambodian provinces where resistance is prevalent, and the increasing frequency of a dominant mutant K13-propeller allele correlates with the recent spread of resistance in western Cambodia. Strong correlations between the presence of a mutant allele, in vitro parasite survival rates and in vivo parasite clearance rates indicate that K13-propeller mutations are important determinants of artemisinin resistance. K13-propeller polymorphism constitutes a useful molecular marker for large-scale surveillance efforts to contain artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion and prevent its global spread. A molecular marker is required to monitor artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites in southeast Asia; here mutations in K13-propeller are associated with artemisinin resistance in vitro and in vivo and also cluster in Cambodian provinces where resistance is prevalent. The spread of resistance to artemisinin in isolates of the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum in southeast Asia threatens to undermine efforts to eliminate the disease around the world. The important task of monitoring resistance has been hampered by the lack of a molecular marker. Fr{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}ric Ariey and colleagues have now identified a major determinant of P. falciparum artemisinin resistance that could provide such a marker. They show that mutations in the PF3D7_1343700 kelch propeller domain (K-13 propeller) of the parasite were linked to the recent spread of resistance. Comparison with samples collected between 2001 and 2012 shows that the marker has increased in frequency in line with the spread of resistance. As well as suggesting a useful marker, these findings could further understanding of how resistance develops, and suggest ways of circumventing resistance in the search for novel antimalarials.},

abstract = {<p>The devastating public health impact of malaria has prompted the need for effective interventions. Malaria control gained traction after the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). However, the emergence of artemisinin (ART) resistance in South-East Asia and reports of delayed parasite sensitivity to ACTs in African parasites signal an imminent treatment failure. Monitoring the prevalence of mutations associated with artemisinin resistance in African populations is required to stop resistance in its tracks. <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> Kelch-13 (<em>Pf</em>k13), <em>Pf</em>coronin and <em>Pf</em>ATPase6 gene mutations have been associated with ART resistance. In this review, we collated findings from published research articles to establish the prevalence of <em>Pf</em>k13, <em>Pf</em>coronin and <em>Pf</em>ATPase6 polymorphisms in Africa. We searched PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar for relevant articles reporting polymorphisms in these genes across Africa between 2014 to 2021. Seventy-two studies which passed the inclusion criteria reported 739 single nucleotide polymorphisms (331 unique variants) from 34,353 samples collected in 26 African countries. Four validated <em>Pf</em>k13 resistant markers linked with delayed parasite clearance were identified in Africa: R561H in Rwanda and Tanzania, M476I in Tanzania, and F446I in Mali, and P553L in Angola. In Tanzania, three (L263E, E431K, and S769N) of the four mutations (L263E, E431K, A623E, and S769N) in <em>Pf</em>ATPase6 gene previously associated with delayed parasite clearance in presence of artemisinin were reported. <em>Pf</em>coronin polymorphisms were reported in Senegal, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya and Congo, with P76S being the most prevalent <em>Pf</em>coronin mutation. Our findings demonstrate independent emergence and widespread distribution of <em>Pfk</em>13, <em>Pf</em>coronin <em>and Pf</em>ATPase6 mutations in Africa. Understanding the phenotypic consequences of these mutations can provide information on the efficacy status of artemisinin-based treatment of malaria in Africa.</p>},

The role of this reservoir in the evolution and spread of drug resistance was explored. Methods Population genetic analyses of the key drug resistance-mediating polymorphisms were analysed in a cross-sectional survey of asymptomatic P. falciparum infections across all ages in Bongo District, Ghana. Results Seven years after the policy change to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in 2005, the Pfcrt K76 and Pfmdr1 N86 wild-type alleles, have nearly reached fixation and have expanded via soft selective sweeps on multiple genetic backgrounds. By constructing the Pfcrt-Pfmdr1-Pfdhfr-Pfdhps multilocus haplotypes we found that the alleles at these loci were in linkage equilibrium and that multidrug resistant parasites haven't expanded in this reservoir. For Pfk13, 32 non-synonymous mutations were identified, however, none were associated with ACT resistance. Conclusions The prevalence and selection of alleles/haplotypes by antimalarials were similar to that observed among clinical cases in Ghana indicating they do not represent two sub-populations with respect to these markers. Thus, the P. falciparum reservoir in all ages can contribute to the maintenance and spread of antimalarial resistance.},

With ever-increasing failure rates associated with chloroquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment, attention has turned to the few alternatives, which include quinine and mefloquine. Here, we have investigated the role of pfmdr1 3′ coding region point mutations in antimalarial drug susceptibility by allelic exchange in the GC03 and 3BA6 parasite lines. Results with pfmdr1-recombinant clones indicate a significant role for the N1042D mutation in contributing to resistance to quinine and its diastereomer quinidine. The triple mutations S1034C/N1042D/D1246Y, highly prevalent in South America, were also found to enhance parasite susceptibility to mefloquine, halofantrine and artemisinin. pfmdr1 3′ mutations showed minimal effect on P. falciparum resistance to chloroquine or its metabolite mono-desethylchloroquine in these parasite lines, in contrast to previously published results obtained with 7G8 parasites. This study supports the hypothesis that pfmdr1 3′ point mutations can significantly affect parasite susceptibility to a wide range of antimalarials in a strain-specific manner that depends on the parasite genetic background.},

Data on the prevalence of resistant alleles in central Africa and the new pfdhps I431V mutation, particularly associated with other mutations to form the pfdhps vagKgs allele, are scarce. We explored the frequency and geographical distribution of pfdhps and pfdhfr mutations in central Africa in 2014–18, and assessed the evolutionary origin of the vagKgs allele. Methods Samples were collected at 18 health-care centres in seven countries (Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Nigeria, and Republic of the Congo) from patients who showed possible symptoms of malaria between March 1, 2014, and Oct 31, 2018. Samples that were positive for P falciparum were transported to a laboratory in Toulouse, France, and genotyped. The frequency of pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations was studied in 1749 samples. Microsatellites in pfdhps flanking regions and whole-genome analysis compared with parasite genomes from the data-sharing network MalariaGEN were performed on samples carrying the vagKgs allele. Findings Mapping of the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms and corresponding alleles of pfdhfr and pfdhps showed a substantial spread of alleles associated with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance in central Africa during the 2014–18 period, especially an increase going west to east in pfdhps alleles carrying the K540E and A581G mutations. A high prevalence of the pfdhps I431V mutation was observed in Cameroon (exceeding 50% in the northern region) and Nigeria. Genomic analysis showed a recent African emergence and a clonal expansion of the most frequent pfdhps vagKgs allele. Interpretation Reduced sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine efficacy due to increased resistance is a worrying situation, especially because the malaria transmission level is high in central Africa. Although the resistance phenotype remains to be confirmed, the emergence and spread of the vagKgs allele in west and central Africa could challenge the use of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine.

A combination of genetic mapping, linkage group selection, and functional genomics was used to identify Pfs47 as a P. falciparum gene that allows the parasite to infect A. gambiae without activating the mosquito immune system. Disruption of Pfs47 greatly reduced parasite survival in the mosquito, and this phenotype could be reverted by genetic complementation of the parasite or by disruption of the mosquito complement-like system. Pfs47 suppresses midgut nitration responses that are critical to activate the complement-like system. We provide direct experimental evidence that immune evasion mediated by Pfs47 is critical for efficient human malaria transmission by A. gambiae.},

abstract = {Mutant forms of the Plasmodium falciparum transporter PfCRT constitute the key determinant of parasite resistance to chloroquine (CQ), the former first-line antimalarial, and are ubiquitous to infections that fail CQ treatment. However, treatment can often be successful in individuals harboring mutant pfcrt alleles, raising questions about the role of host immunity or pharmacokinetics vs. the parasite genetic background in contributing to treatment outcomes. To examine whether the parasite genetic background dictates the degree of mutant pfcrt-mediated CQ resistance, we replaced the wild type pfcrt allele in three CQ-sensitive strains with mutant pfcrt of the 7G8 allelic type prevalent in South America, the Oceanic region and India. Recombinant clones exhibited strain-dependent CQ responses that ranged from high-level resistance to an incremental shift that did not meet CQ resistance criteria. Nonetheless, even in the most susceptible clones, 7G8 mutant pfcrt enabled parasites to tolerate CQ pressure and recrudesce in vitro after treatment with high concentrations of CQ. 7G8 mutant pfcrt was found to significantly impact parasite responses to other antimalarials used in artemisinin-based combination therapies, in a strain-dependent manner. We also report clinical isolates from French Guiana that harbor mutant pfcrt, identical or related to the 7G8 haplotype, and manifest a CQ tolerance phenotype. One isolate, H209, harbored a novel PfCRT C350R mutation and demonstrated reduced quinine and artemisinin susceptibility. Our data: 1) suggest that high-level CQR is a complex biological process dependent on the presence of mutant pfcrt; 2) implicate a role for variant pfcrt alleles in modulating parasite susceptibility to other clinically important antimalarials; and 3) uncover the existence of a phenotype of CQ tolerance in some strains harboring mutant pfcrt.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Emergence of artemisinin partial resistance (ArtR) in Plasmodium falciparum in East Africa is a growing threat to the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) and the global efforts for malaria elimination. The emergence of Pfkelch13 R561H in Rwanda, raised concern about the impact in neighboring Tanzania, despite contemporary surveys suggesting limited 561H in the country. In addition, regional concern over resistance affecting sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which is used for chemoprevention strategies is high. Methods To enhance longitudinal monitoring, the Molecular Surveillance of Malaria in Tanzania (MSMT) project was launched in 2020 with the goal of assessing and mapping the profile of antimalarial resistance across transmission zones. Community and clinic samples were assessed for resistance polymorphisms using a high throughput molecular inversion probe platform. Findings Genotyping of 6,278 samples collected in 2021 revealed a focus of Pfkelch13 561H mutants in North-western Tanzania with prevalence of 7.7% (50/649) in Kagera. A small number of 561H mutants (about 1%) were found as far as 800 km away in Tabora, Manyara, and Njombe. Genomic analysis suggests some of these parasites are highly related to previous isolates collected in Rwanda in 2015, supporting regional spread of 561H. However, a novel haplotype was also observed, likely indicating a second origin in the region. Other validated resistance polymorphisms (622I and 675V) were also identified. A focus of high sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance was also identified in Kagera with a prevalence of dhfr 164L of 15% (80/526). Interpretation These findings demonstrate Pfkelch 561H resistant mutation is entrenched in the region and that multiple origins of ArtR, similar as to what was seen in Southeast Asia, are likely to occur. Mutations associated with high levels of SP resistance are increasing. These results raise concerns about the long-term efficacy of artemisinin and chemoprevention antimalarials in the region.},

In this study, we combine multiplex PCR, custom designed dual indexing and Miseq sequencing for high throughput SNP-profiling of 457 malaria infections from Guinea-Bissau, at the cost of 10 USD per sample. By amplifying and sequencing 15 genetic fragments, we cover 20 resistance-conferring SNPs occurring in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, as well as the entire length of pfK13, and the mitochondrial barcode for parasite origin. SNPs of interest were sequenced with an average depth of 2,043 reads, and bases were called for the various SNP-positions with a p-value below 0.05, for 89.8–100% of samples. The SNP data indicates that artemisinin resistance-conferring SNPs in pfK13 are absent from the studied area of Guinea-Bissau, while the pfmdr1 86 N allele is found at a high prevalence. The mitochondrial barcodes are unanimous and accommodate a West African origin of the parasites. With this method, very reliable high throughput surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance becomes more affordable than ever before.},

abstract = {Zanzibar has recently undergone a rapid decline in Plasmodium falciparum transmission following combined malaria control interventions with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and integrated vector control. Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) was implemented as first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Zanzibar in 2003. Resistance to amodiaquine has been associated with the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles pfcrt 76T, pfmdr1 86Y, 184Y and 1246Y. An accumulation of these SNP alleles in the parasite population over time might threaten ASAQ efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess whether prolonged use of ASAQ as first-line anti-malarial treatment selects for P. falciparum SNPs associated with resistance to the ACT partner drug amodiaquine. The individual as well as the combined SNP allele prevalence were compared in pre-treatment blood samples from patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria enrolled in clinical trials conducted just prior to the introduction of ASAQ in 2002–2003 (n = 208) and seven years after wide scale use of ASAQ in 2010 (n = 122). There was a statistically significant decrease of pfcrt 76T (96–63%), pfmdr1 86Y (75–52%), 184Y (83–72%), 1246Y (28–16%) and the most common haplotypes pfcrt/pfmdr1 TYYD (46–26%) and TYYY (17–8%), while an increase of pfcrt/pfmdr1 KNFD (0.4–14%) and KNYD (1–12%). This is the first observation of a decreased prevalence of pfcrt 76T, pfmdr1 86Y, 184Y and 1246Y in an African setting after several years of extensive ASAQ use as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. This may support sustained efficacy of ASAQ on Zanzibar, although it was unexpected considering that all these SNPs have previously been associated with amodiaquine resistance. The underlying factors of these results are unclear. Genetic dilution by imported P. falciparum parasites from mainland Tanzania, a de-selection by artesunate per se and/or an associated fitness cost might represent contributing factors. More detailed studies on temporal trends of molecular markers associated with amodiaquine resistance are required to improve the understanding of this observation.},

The Plasmodium falciparum Pfs47 gene has strong geographic population structure, because only those parasites with Pfs47 haplotypes compatible with the mosquito vector species in a given continent are efficiently transmitted. Analysis of 4,971 world-wide Pfs47 sequences identified two SNPs (at 707 and 725 bp) as sufficient to establish the likely continent of origin of P. falciparum isolates. Pfs47 sequences from Africa, Asia, and the New World presented more that 99% frequency of distinct combinations of the SNPs 707 and 725 genotypes. Interestingly, Papua New Guinea Pfs47 sequences have the highest diversity in SNPs 707 and 725. Accurate and reproducible High-Resolution Melting (HRM) assays were developed to genotype Pfs47 SNPs 707 and 725 in laboratory and field samples, to assess the geographic origin and risk of local transmission of imported P. falciparum malaria cases. Molina-Cruz et al. analyzed 4,971 sequences of the Plasmodium falciparum Pfs47 gene and identified a combination of two SNP haplotypes highly correlated with geographic origin and transmission potential by mosquito vectors. A simple High-Resolution Melting RT-PCR assay was developed to genotype these SNPs and establish the likely continent of origin and transmission risk of P. falciparum isolates.},

abstract = {Despite the pharmacodynamic advantages with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and some potentially opposite molecular mechanisms of tolerance to amodiaquine (AQ)/desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ) and artesunate (ART), there is a risk for rapid decay in efficacy if the two drugs are unable to ensure mutual prevention against a selection and spread of drug-resistant parasites.We have studied if mutations in the pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes selected in recurrent infections after AQ monotherapy are also selected after AQ plus ART combination therapy.Samples for molecular analysis were derived from three clinical trials on children <5 years old with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria; one AQ monotherapy study conducted in Kenya 2003 and two AQ plus ART combination therapy studies conducted in Zanzibar 2002–2003 and 2005, respectively.The PCR-adjusted treatment failure rates in the three studies were 19%, 8% and 9%, respectively. After monotherapy there was a significant selection of pfcrt 76T in re-infections (OR not calculable; p=0.048) and of pfmdr1 86Y in recrudescent infections (OR 8.0; p=0.048). No such selection was found after combination therapy. A selection of pfmdr1 1246Y and the pfmdr1 haplotype (a.a 86, 184, 1246) YYY was found in recrudescent infections both after monotherapy (OR 7.6; p=0.009 and OR 3.1; p=0.029) and combination therapy in 2005 (OR 3.6; p=0.017 and OR 5.4; p<0.001).Hence, pfmdr1 1246Y with synergistic or compensatory addition of pfmdr1 86Y and 184Y appears to be involved in AQ/DEAQ resistance and treatment failure. Our results suggest that ART may protect against a selection of these SNPs initially, but maybe not after continuous drug pressure in a population. However, treatment failure rate and spread of pfmdr1 SNPs may remain at a low level because of the suggested opposite selection by ART and the pharmacodynamic advantages with ACT.},

Here we use zinc-finger nucleases to genetically modify the multidrug resistance-1 transporter PfMDR1 at amino acids 86 and 184, and demonstrate that the widely prevalent N86Y mutation augments resistance to the ACT partner drug amodiaquine and the former first-line agent chloroquine. In contrast, N86Y increases parasite susceptibility to the partner drugs lumefantrine and mefloquine, and the active artemisinin metabolite dihydroartemisinin. The PfMDR1 N86 plus Y184F isoform moderately reduces piperaquine potency in strains expressing an Asian/African variant of the chloroquine resistance transporter PfCRT. Mutations in both digestive vacuole-resident transporters are thought to differentially regulate ACT drug interactions with host haem, a product of parasite-mediated haemoglobin degradation. Global mapping of these mutations illustrates where the different ACTs could be selectively deployed to optimize treatment based on regional differences in PfMDR1 haplotypes. Antimalarial chemotherapy relies on combination therapies (ACTs) consisting of an artemisinin derivative and a partner drug. Here, the authors study the effects of globally prevalent mutations in a multidrug resistance transporter (PfMDR1) on the parasite's susceptibility to ACT drugs.},

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria in humans. An important class of drugs in malaria treatment is the sulfone/sulfonamide group, of which sulfadoxine is the most commonly used. The target of sulfadoxine is the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), and sequencing of the DHPS gene has identified amino acid differences that may be involved in the mechanism of resistance to this drug. In this study we have sequenced the DHPS gene in 10 isolates from Thailand and identified a new allele of DHPS that has a previously unidentified amino acid difference. We have expressed eight alleles of P. falciparum PPPK-DHPS in Escherichia coli and purified the functional enzymes to homogeneity. Strikingly, the Ki for sulfadoxine varies by almost three orders of magnitude from 0.14 $\mu$M for the DHPS allele from sensitive isolates to 112 $\mu$M for an enzyme expressed in a highly resistant isolate. Comparison of the Ki of different sulfonamides and the sulfone dapsone has suggested that the amino acid differences in DHPS would confer cross-resistance to these compounds. These results show that the amino acid differences in the DHPS enzyme of sulfadoxine-resistant isolates of P. falciparum are central to the mechanism of resistance to sulfones and sulfonamides.},

Because loci critical to fertility in many eukaryote species have been shown to be under strong positive selection, we examined sequence variation in four members of the 6-cys protein gene family in Plasmodium falciparum (Pfs36, Pfs38, Pfs47 and Pfs48/45) to determine whether genetic variation in these loci may be of functional significance. Sequence polymorphism among 11 laboratory isolates of P. falciparum was compared with divergence from the respective orthologues in the closely related species P. reichenowi, showing an almost significant skew towards within-species non-synonymous polymorphism in Pfs47 and Pfs48/45 (by the McDonald–Kreitman test) but clearly non-significant results for Pfs36 and Pfs38. A preliminary analysis of Pfs47 sequence polymorphism in field isolates of P. falciparum showed exceptionally high fixation indices (F ST) among geographically distinct populations, similar to results seen previously for Pfs48/45. Therefore, both Pfs47 and Pfs48/45 were further analysed by sequencing polymorphic parts of the genes from a Tanzanian population sample of oocysts (a means of analysing diploid genotypes). Both genes displayed higher inbreeding coefficients (F IS) compared with the average of 11 unlinked microsatellite loci. These results suggest that allelic variation in these two genes may be functionally significant in influencing mating interactions, a hypothesis that could be tested by fertilization experiments with targeted allelic replacement.},
