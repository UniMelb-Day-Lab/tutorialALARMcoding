In eukaryotic populations such as Plasmodium falciparum infections, it is important to discriminate sequences differing by a single nucleotide polymorphism. In bacterial populations, single-base resolution can provide improved resolution towards species and strains. Here, we introduce the SeekDeep suite built around the qluster algorithm, which is capable of accurately building de novo clusters representing true, biological local haplotypes differing by just a single base. It outperforms current software, particularly at low frequencies and at low input read depths, whether resolving single-base differences or traditional OTUs. SeekDeep is open source and works with all major sequencing technologies, making it broadly useful in a wide variety of applications of amplicon deep sequencing to extract accurate and maximal biologic information.}},

In contrast, sulfadoxine-resistance markers in dihydropteroate synthase show marked spatial structure with ongoing spread of double and triple mutants compared with 2007. These findings suggest that parasites in the DRC remain panmictic despite rapidly spreading antimalarial-resistance mutations.

High malaria burden settings have received renewed attention acknowledging their critical role in malaria elimination. Defining the role for parasite genomics in driving these high burden settings towards elimination will enhance future control programme planning. Amplicon deep sequencing was used to characterize parasite population genetic diversity at polymorphic Plasmodium falciparum loci, Pfama1 and Pfcsp, at two timepoints in June–July 2016 and January–March 2017 in a high transmission region along the international border between Luapula Province, Zambia and Haut-Katanga Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). High genetic diversity was observed across both seasons and in both countries. No evidence of population structure was observed between parasite populations on either side of the border, suggesting that this region may be one contiguous transmission zone. Despite a decline in parasite prevalence at the sampling locations in Haut-Katanga Province, no genetic signatures of a population bottleneck were detected, suggesting that larger declines in transmission may be required to reduce parasite genetic diversity. Analysing rare variants may be a suitable alternative approach for detecting epidemiologically important genetic signatures in highly diverse populations; however, the challenge is distinguishing true signals from potential artifacts introduced by small sample sizes. Continuing to explore and document the utility of various parasite genotyping approaches for understanding malaria transmission in holoendemic settings will be valuable to future control and elimination programmes, empowering evidence-based selection of tools and methods to address pertinent questions, thus enabling more efficient resource allocation.}},

abstract = {{Deep sequencing of targeted genomic regions is becoming a common tool for understanding the dynamics and complexity of Plasmodium infections, but its lower limit of detection is currently unknown. Here, a new amplicon analysis tool, the Parallel Amplicon Sequencing Error Correction (PASEC) pipeline, is used to evaluate the performance of amplicon sequencing on low-density Plasmodium DNA samples. Illumina-based sequencing of two Plasmodium falciparum genomic regions (CSP and SERA2) was performed on two types of samples: in vitro DNA mixtures mimicking low-density infections (1–200 genomes/μl) and extracted blood spots from a combination of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (44–653,080 parasites/μl). Three additional analysis tools—DADA2, HaplotypR, and SeekDeep—were applied to both datasets and the precision and sensitivity of each tool were evaluated. Amplicon sequencing can contend with low-density samples, showing reasonable detection accuracy down to a concentration of 5 Plasmodium genomes/μl. Due to increased stochasticity and background noise, however, all four tools showed reduced sensitivity and precision on samples with very low parasitaemia (< 5 copies/μl) or low read count (< 100 reads per amplicon). PASEC could distinguish major from minor haplotypes with an accuracy of 90\% in samples with at least 30 Plasmodium genomes/μl, but only 61\% at low Plasmodium concentrations (< 5 genomes/μl) and 46\% at very low read counts (< 25 reads per amplicon). The four tools were additionally used on a panel of extracted parasite-positive blood spots from natural malaria infections. While all four identified concordant patterns of complexity of infection (COI) across four sub-Saharan African countries, COI values obtained for individual samples differed in some cases. Amplicon deep sequencing can be used to determine the complexity and diversity of low-density Plasmodium infections. Despite differences in their approach, four state-of-the-art tools resolved known haplotype mixtures with similar sensitivity and precision. Researchers can therefore choose from multiple robust approaches for analysing amplicon data, however, error filtration approaches should not be uniformly applied across samples of varying parasitaemia. Samples with very low parasitaemia and very low read count have higher false positive rates and call for read count thresholds that are higher than current default recommendations.}},

Compared to ama1, csp, and msp1 amplicons, cpmp required the smallest sample size to detect differences in infection complexity between transmission risk zones. Transmission intensity was highest within 5 km of the irrigation scheme by polymerase chain reaction positivity rate, infection complexity, and linkage disequilibrium. The irrigated area provided a source of parasite infections for the surrounding 2- to 10-km area.

Understanding parasite diversity is important for identification of specific human or parasite populations that can be targeted by control programs, and to monitor the spread of mutations associated with drug resistance. An up‐to‐date understanding of regional parasite population dynamics is also critical to monitor the impact of control efforts. However, this data is largely absent from high‐burden nations in Africa, and to date, no such analysis has been conducted for malaria parasites in Tanzania country‐wide. To this end, over 1,000 P. falciparum clinical isolates were collected in 2017 from 13 sites in seven administrative regions across Tanzania, and parasites were genotyped at 1,800 variable positions genome‐wide using molecular inversion probes. Population structure was detectable among Tanzanian P. falciparum parasites, roughly separating parasites from the northern and southern districts and identifying genetically admixed populations in the north. Isolates from nearby districts were more likely to be genetically related compared to parasites sampled from more distant districts. Known drug resistance mutations were seen at increased frequency in northern districts (including two infections carrying pfk13‐R561H), and additional variants with undetermined significance for antimalarial resistance also varied by geography. Malaria Indicator Survey (2017) data corresponded with genetic findings, including average region‐level complexity‐of‐infection and malaria prevalence estimates. The parasite populations identified here provide important information on extant spatial patterns of genetic diversity of Tanzanian parasites, to which future surveys of genetic relatedness can be compared.}}

P. falciparum positive samples were obtained from a triple artemisinin combination therapy clinical trial conducted in 30 children under 13 years of age between 2018 and 2019 in Kilifi, Kenya. Of the 30 participants, 9 presented with recurrent parasitemia from day 26 (624h) onwards. The ama1 and mdr1 genes were amplified and sequenced, while msp1, msp2 and glurp data were obtained from the original clinical study. The COI was comparable between ama1 and msp1, msp2 and glurp , however, overall ama1 detected more haplotypes. Based on ama1 , a stable number of haplotypes were detected throughout treatment up until day 3. Additionally, a recrudescent infection was identified with an ama1 haplotype initially observed at 30h and later in an unscheduled follow-up visit. Using the relative frequencies of ama1 haplotypes and parasitaemia, we identified a fast (<1h) and slow (>5h) clearing haplotype. As expected, only two mdr1 haplotypes (NF and NY) were identified based on the combination of amino acid polymorphisms at codons 86 and 184. This study highlights TADS as a sensitive tool for tracking parasite haplotypes throughout treatment and can detect variation in haplotype clearance estimates. TADS can also identify slow clearing haplotypes, a potential early sign of selection during treatment. Consequently, TADS has the capability of improving the discriminatory power to accurately distinguish recrudescences from reinfections.}},

Real-time PCR identified 500 P. falciparum-positive samples that were amplified at five drug resistance loci for targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS).

We also develop a cheap, nondestructive, and high‐throughput DNA extraction workflow that provides template DNA from single mosquitoes for the multiplex PCR, which means specimens producing unexpected results can be returned to for morphological examination. Over 1000 individual mosquitoes can be sequenced in a single MiSeq run, and we demonstrate the panel’s power to assign species identity using sequencing data for 40 species from Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. We also show that the approach can be used to resolve geographic population structure within An. gambiae and An. coluzzii populations, as the population structure determined based on these 62 loci from over 1000 mosquitoes closely mirrors that revealed through whole genome sequencing.
