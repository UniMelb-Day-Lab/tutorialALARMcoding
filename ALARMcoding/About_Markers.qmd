## What is *ALARM*coding?

*ALARM*coding, or **A**daptive **L**oci of **A**ntimalarial **R**esistance **M**arkers **coding**, is a multiplex and nested PCR methodology to amplify 6 markers of drug resistance and one marker of vector competence. This panel has been optimised for asymptomatic data but can be used across a range of parasite densities, including clinical infections, and uses Amplicon Sequencing technology to also identify codons of interest in both single- and multiple-clone infections, where the latter are common in highly endemic countries.

### Drug Resistance Markers

*pfcrt*, *dhfr*, *dhps*, *K13*, *mdr1* and *aat1* are molecular markers of drug resistance in *Plasmodium falciparum*. CQR is caused by common mutants in genes that encode P. falciparum transmembrane proteins chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT, codons 72-76), an ATP-binding cassette transporter and homologue of multidrug-resistance P-glycoprotein (PfMDR1 or Pgh1, codons 86, 184, 1034, 1042, 1246) and a putative amino acid transporter (PfAat1, codons 258, 313). For a detailed description on these markers see [this page](About_Resistance.qmd). 

### Vector Competence: A New Strategy

To address the recent invasion of *An. stephensi* in Africa, a marker of vector competence was included in the ALARMcoding panel. *P. falciparum* surface protein 47 (*pfs47*) encodes for the 6-cysteine protein *pfs47* (also known as P47 or TEP1) that is expressed on the gametocyte surface and allows region-specific *P. falciparum* to evade the local vector immune response in the ookinete stage and persist to later developmental stages. This mediates the extent to which *P. falciparum* survives. *pfs47*-mediated immune evasion in the Anopheles spp. vector is required for parasites to persist in an endemic area [@Molina-Cruz2013]. There is strong geographic structure of *pfs47* with lower haplotype diversity out of Africa [@Anthony2007; @Molina-Cruz2015; @Molina-Cruz2015b], supporting observations that: 

(i) *P. falciparum* isolates from Africa could infect both *An. gambiae* (African vector) and *An. stephensi* (South/Southeast Asian vector), while *P. falciparum* isolates from southeast Asia had a lower success at infecting *An. gambiae* [@Hume2003], and 
(ii) African strains (GB4 and NF54) were able to survive in *An. gambiae* but 7G8 (New World strain) cannot [@Canepa2016]. 


In the context of malaria genomic surveillance of drug resistance, *pfs47* (chromosome 13) can be monitored to inform whether parasites have migrated/invaded from another region. It can therefore also be used as a positive control to confirm the vector-parasite relationship in the region of interest. Non-synonymous mutations in T236I, V247A, S242L and I248L resulted in the mosquito immune system clearing the parasite [@Canepa2016]. Polymorphisms at codons 236 and 242 were found to be strongly related with geographic variation in the *pfs47* gene across South America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific [@Molina-Cruz2021]. 


A recent study characterised polymorphisms of entire *pfs47* gene in Western Kenya and found low and non-significant FST, with 8 loci that segregated in the population: E27D, E188D, P194H, L240I, I249L, N272I/Y, I304L. Only P194H and N272I were identified as SNPs while the other loci were parsimony informative [@Onyango2021].
